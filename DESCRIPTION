Description: ROC-GLM Implementation for DataSHIELD to conduct and visualize ROC analysis on decentralized data. 
    The basis is the DataSHIELD (https://www.datashield.org) infrastructure for distributed computing. This 
    package provides the calculation of the ROC-GLM (https://www.jstor.org/stable/2676973?seq=1) as well as
    AUC confidence intervals (https://www.jstor.org/stable/2531595?seq=1). In order to calculate the ROC-GLM 
    it is necessry to push models and predict them at the servers. This is done automatically by the base package
    dsPredictBase (https://github.com/difuture-lmu/dsPredictBase). Note that DataSHIELD uses an option 
    `datashield.privacyLevel` to indicate the minimal amount of numbers required to be allowed to share an 
    aggregated value of these numbers. Instead of setting the option, we directly retrieve the privacy level from the 
    DESCRIPTION (https://github.com/difuture-lmu/dsROCGLM/blob/master/DESCRIPTION) file each time a function calls 
    for it. This options is set to 5 by default.
